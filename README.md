## Generating Sketches from Photos

### Abstract

 Drawing is a way of expressing things and emotions. It is a useful skill, also a form of art. Computers are powerful tools invented for assisting humans to do different tasks. People are always looking for what else computers can do. Researchers aimed to teach machines to draw in order to make machines help people perform drawing tasks, and further study whether machines can create art. Many researchers have found ways to teach machines to draw. Due to the development of machine learning and the boom of touchscreen devices in recent years, there are many usable machine learning techniques, and more datasets are available. As a result, teaching machines to draw free-hand sketches has become more prevalent recently. In this report, we mainly focused on teaching machines to draw free-hand sketches. Free-hand sketches are drawn by a series of pen strokes, rather than some sketches drawn ‘pixel by pixel’ by machine. We implemented a simple but useful photo to sketch model from a sketchRNN stroke-sequence to sketch model. We introduced the related work, our research hypothesis, the datasets and methodology we used, and the metrics and benchmarks in our experiments. In the end, we discussed the limitations in our research and future work.
